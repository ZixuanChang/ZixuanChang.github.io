Here is **Zixuan Zhang (Victor, [张子轩](https://caihanlin.com/file/ZZX_CV.pdf))**. I am a graduate student of University of Chinese Academy of Science, Institute of Process Engineering, majoring in **Chemical Engineering**. I am now supervised by [Prof. Xin Xiao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0046355?language=en) in the[ Industrial Intelligence Optimization Research Group](http://mercgrsmr.ipe.ac.cn/xsdw/ktz/202204/t20220419_27305.html). Here is my [ ORCID ](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-7354-0499).

**I am applying for a PhD position in 2026 Fall**, and here is [my CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/Resume-HanlinCAI.pdf).


## Education Background
- **Sep 2023 - June 2026:** Chemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Science (Master's Degree)
- **Sep 2019 - July 2023:** Chemical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University (Bachelor's Degree)
